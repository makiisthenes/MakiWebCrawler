# MakiWebCrawler
Trying to make a webcrawler that extract image urls and indexing different websites.
The webcrawlers goal when entering a website is to scrape all images and find any links on this specific website.
All images found will be indexed URL's for data collection. 
The pictures will then be downloaded and inserted URL into the metadata.
Need to make/ use an library for generating headers and seem like a geniune device.
